# Latch

Latch is a 2D shooter game tech demo built with a custom rendering engine based on AWT and Swing. All sprites are hand drawn.

## Running

Clone the repository and navigate to its root directory in a terminal. Run `java -jar latch.jar` to launch the game. The jar file in the root directory includes a recent build of the application.

## Building

Alternatively, if you want to download the source and build the latest version of the game, you can open the project in Eclipse or another IDE and make the entry point `Game.java`.
